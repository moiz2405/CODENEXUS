cd personalized-learning-platform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Frontend (React/Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Backend (Node.js/Express)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Set up the Database

- **PostgreSQL**: Create a database and configure connection settings.
- **MongoDB**: Set up a MongoDB instance for AI data storage.

### 4. Run the Application

#### Frontend (React.js/Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

#### Backend (Node.js/Express)
